# Contributing to Agent CLI Framework

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes. Keep them focused -- one concern per PR.
3. If you add a pattern, include it in both the README and the `example/` CLI.
4. Test that the example builds and all behaviors work:
   ```bash
   cd example && cargo build --release
   ./target/release/greeter hello Boris --style pirate
   ./target/release/greeter hello Boris | jq        # JSON envelope
   ./target/release/greeter hello "" 2>&1; echo $?  # exit code 3
   ./target/release/greeter --help > /dev/null; echo $?  # exit code 0
   ./target/release/greeter agent-info | jq          # valid manifest
   ```
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why.

## Project structure

```

    main.rs            # Entry point: parse, detect format, dispatch, exit
    cli.rs             # Clap derive definitions
    error.rs           # Error enum with exit_code(), error_code(), suggestion()
    output.rs          # Format detection + JSON envelope helpers
    commands/
      mod.rs           # Re-exports
      hello.rs         # Domain command example
      agent_info.rs    # Capability manifest
      skill.rs         # Skill install + status

## What's useful

- New patterns or refinements to existing ones, backed by real-world agent usage.
- Bug fixes or improvements to the example CLI.
- Documentation improvements that make the patterns clearer or more precise.
- Integration tests that verify framework invariants (help exits 0, piped output is valid JSON, etc.).
- Links to additional CLIs built with this architecture.

## Guidelines

- The example demonstrates the five core patterns plus the entry point, error type, and output helpers. Reusable modules like config loading, secret handling, and HTTP retry are documented as code patterns in the README -- they don't need to be in the example.
- Keep the example minimal -- it demonstrates patterns, not a real product.
- Ensure the README, AGENTS.md, and example stay consistent with each other.

## Style

- Write like you're explaining to a colleague. Short sentences. Active voice.
- Code examples should be minimal and runnable.
- If you reference a claim, link to the source.
